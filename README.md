# tournament-udacity
This is an implementation of a simple swiss tournament
made in python using a postgresql server.

This was made using PYTHON 3, which i had to use instead
due to issues installing the postgresql api to python 2.7
on the computer i am using. If it is an issue to compile
these with python3 then please send it back I will modify
the print statements in tournament.py and tournament_test.py
back to python2 syntax.

INSTRUCTIONS
initialize a postgresql server using 'psql server_name'
import my tournaments.sql file using =>'\i tournaments.sql'
run tournament_test.py with a python3 interpreter to check
functionality
